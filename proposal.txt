Our dataset, called FiveThirtyEight Police Killings Dataset, can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/fivethirtyeight-police-killings-dataset. Some key attributes are name, age, gender, race ethnicity, city, state, law enforcement agency, armed or not, color of skin, and cause of death. This dataset includes 467 killed by the police. Our approach will be classification learning using the necessary attributes mentioned above to train a model that will predict the cause of death, whether it was a gunshot, taser, struck by vehicle, or death while in custody. Possible transformations include location of the incident. We cannot possible use its exact longitude and latitude. Instead, we can put the locations into bins, or regions of America (or perhaps to just use the state and remove the longitude and latitude attributes). We are going to use classification data mining to investigate different trends based on different attributes. The data graphics will be used to show any trends we find. We will apply python programs with different queries to build relational tables. The tables will also be used to get the average number of shootings per state, per race, etc. We will divide the work by having one person do the data mining, one person to do the python programming, and one person to put it all together and find the patterns. We plan on checking each other’s work and helping each other if any of us run into problems.
